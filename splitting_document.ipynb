      "Why do we use vectors?\n",
      "A vector is just a list of numbers.\n",
      "When we make an embedding, we need a format that keeps all those numbers together — that’s exactly what a vector is.\n",

      "How close two meanings are (using distance between vectors)\n",
      "What direction the meaning moves in (e.g., man → woman, car → truck)\n",
      "So we use vectors because they let the computer compare meanings with math — fast and accurate.\n",

The president is permitted to veto specific legislative acts, but Congress has the authority to override presidential vetoes by two-thirds majorities of both houses. The Constitution also provides that the Senate advise and consent on key executive and judicial appointments and on the approval for ratification of treaties.\n",
      "The last 300 of : For over two centuries the Constitution has remained in force because its framers successfully separated and balanced governmental powers to safeguard the interests of majority rule and minority rights, of liberty and equality, and of the federal and state governments. More a concise statement of national principles than a detailed plan of governmental operation, the Constitution has evolved to meet the changing needs of a modern society profoundly different from the eighteenth-century world in which its creators lived. To date, the Constitution has been amended 27 times, most recently in 1992. The first ten amendments constitute the Bill of Rights.\n"
