What is embedding?
An embedding is like turning words or sentences into numbers so a computer can understand their meaning.
Example:
“Cat” might become [0.9, 0.2, 0.1]
“Dog” might become [0.8, 0.25, 0.12]
Because the numbers are close, the computer knows cat and dog mean similar things.
So embedding = a way to represent meaning as numbers.
Why do we use vectors?
A vector is just a list of numbers.
When we make an embedding, we need a format that keeps all those numbers together — that’s exactly what a vector is.
Using vectors lets the computer measure:
How close two meanings are (using distance between vectors)
What direction the meaning moves in (e.g., man → woman, car → truck)
So we use vectors because they let the computer compare meanings with math — fast and accurate.
What is a vector database?
A vector database is a special kind of storage that can quickly find which embeddings (vectors) are most similar to a new one.
When you ask a question, your question becomes a vector — the database finds the closest stored vectors (the most related pieces of text).
It’s like a search engine that looks for similar meanings, not just matching words.
In one line:
Embedding → turns text into numbers that show meaning.
Vector → holds those numbers together so we can measure similarity.
Vector Database → finds which stored meanings are closest to what you asked.
That’s how RAG “remembers” and finds the right info before the AI answers
